# projectM

This was a project that I had 2 years ago to make a simple 2D side-scroller using SFML. I did not get very far into it, but I actually built a pretty nice base for it and wanted to leave it here for future reference. The code was heavily based on the book "SFML Game Development" which helped me a lot. It may not be fully working right now

The name "projectM" stand for "Project Mario", I am not the best with coming up with names and I just wanted to do a simple game and Mario came up to my head.

The indentation is a bit messed up due to using tabs and spaces (I was not aware at the time that Visual Studio was using both, and it gets a little bit messed up while viewing in GitHub. If you open in a text editor with tabspace 4 it should be okay. I will fix this once I have time)

### Dependecies
1. SFML
2. box2D
3. tmxloader

### Images

Here is a .gif that I made for the SFML forums just to show how the game was at that point.

And here is a picture of how I was building the levels (I was using Tiled to generate them)

### More info

* I do not intend to continue this, like I said at the beggining I just wanted to post this for future reference.
* If you have any doubts about a specific part of the code I will gladly try and remember why/how I did something, but this implementation is not the best, but can be used as a starting point (possibly).
* The compiled libraries (SFML, tmxloader, etc) are obviously not included in the repo, if you want to actually compile these, go and find them on their specific websites.
* I used Visual Studio so there is some compiler specific things in the code.

The resources used here were mostly open-source but I got them so long ago that I do not remember the names of the people that did all of them, sorry. A quick google search will come up with the name of the people that made them if you are interested in using them!
